# LSB Phase Status

> Only a human edits this file. Claude Code may not cross a locked phase
> (Implementation Plan v3.0, Part 0 — Physics rule).

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Phase A | "Prove" — scaffold, config/schema, data audit, signal engine, backtest, determinism, walk-forward, verdict (Sessions A0–A11, Gate GA) | **ACTIVE** |
| Phase B | Forward test + parallel hardening — broker bridge, 5-state machine, live loop, monitoring, Docker, VPS shadow (Sessions B1–B10, Gate GB) | **LOCKED — human unlock only, after a Gate GA GO** |
| Phase C | "Scale" — VPS promotion, 10% review, outcome learning activation (Sessions C1–C3) | **LOCKED — human unlock only, after a Gate GB GO** |

## Phase A schema

Migration `001_core.sql` (Session A1) — four tables: `config_version`,
`candle`, `signal`, `wf_run` (+ child `sim_trade`). The seven-table v2.1
schema is restored verbatim in Phase B Track 2 (Session B5); its DDL
already exists and deferring it costs nothing.

## Signal engine (Sessions A4–A5)

Gates 1–8 of the M7 entry qualifier are complete. `src/lsb/signals/`:

| Gate | Name | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Trend alignment | done (A4) |
| 2 | Structure present | done (A4); **rising-lows leg corrected in A6 — see ADR-004** (strict all-pivot monotonicity made gate 2 permanently dead; now §6.1.1 ≥2 higher lows each ≥0.20% + compression ≤60%) |
| 3 | Liquidity sweep confirmed | done (A4) |
| 4 | Sweep quality (5-factor score) | done (A4) |
| 5 | Candle confirmation | done (A5) — REJECTION/ENGULFING in direction + wick/body ≥ 2× + close beyond swept level |
| 6 | Volatility acceptable | done (A5) — blocks EXTREME ATR; spread ≤ max_spread_pips |
| 7 | Session & news | done (A5) — session UTC bands + edge buffer; **news/liquidity = stub-pass (M12, Phase B)** |
| 8 | Risk viable | done (A5) — structural stop §9.1 + R:R ≥ 2.5 §9.4; **drawdown/tier = stub-pass (M11, Phase B)** |

`evaluate()` now runs all eight gates short-circuiting; `SignalResult.qualified` is the true
eight-gate conjunction. `schema_version` bumped 3→4 (gate 5–8 params in `SignalParams`).
New modules: `signals/session.py`, `signals/risk.py`.

**Phase-A qualification note:** Gate 7's news filter and Gate 8's drawdown/tier check are
documented stub-passes for all Phase-A evaluations. Live trading still requires Phase B
(Gate GB GO), so no un-checked setup can reach a broker order.

## Backtest engine (Sessions A6–A7)

`src/lsb/backtest/` — event-driven replay core. Modules:

| Module | Role |
|---|---|
| `data.py` | Parquet loader → `list[Candle]`, schema-validated, sorted |
| `clock.py` | `ReplayClock` — injectable clock, emits candle timestamps, no wall-clock reads |
| `broker.py` | `Broker` Protocol + `NaiveBroker` (optimistic) + `SimulatedBroker` (§7.1 pessimistic) + `PendingOrder`/`Fill` |
| `position.py` | `Position` dataclass + `PosState` enum + `r_now()` + `commission`/`swap` cost fields |
| `manage.py` | §11.2 breakeven, §11.3 EMA21 trail, §11.4 partial/full exits, §10.3 expiry |
| `book.py` | `PositionBook` — ADR-003 pyramiding policy, book-wide exits |
| `sink.py` | `NullSink` (CI-safe, in-memory) + `DbSink` (wraps `signals/persist.py`) |
| `loop.py` | `run_backtest()` — per-candle driver with look-ahead guard |

`schema_version` bumped 4→5 (four `pyramid_*` fields per ADR-003), then 5→6
(three `triangle_*` fields per ADR-004 structure-gate fix). No bump for A7
(`BrokerCosts` was already in the config schema from A1).
CLI: `scripts/run_backtest.py EURUSD [--db] [--from YYYY-MM-DD] [--to YYYY-MM-DD] [--all]`.

**Owner decision (ADR-003):** Pyramiding built in from A6. Off by default
(`pyramid_enabled: false`). See `docs/decisions/ADR-003-pyramiding.md`.

**Session A7 — SimulatedBroker (§7.1 pessimistic fill model):**
- Spread: historical `candle.spread` when present, else per-instrument constant from `BrokerCosts`; applied at entry only (D4).
- Slippage: `slippage_atr_mult × ATR`, doubled in EXTREME state; always against the position (D5). ATR state tagged on `PendingOrder` at staging time.
- Gap-through-trigger (entry): `base = max(trigger, candle.open)` long / `min(trigger, candle.open)` short.
- Gap-through-stop (exit): `fill_stop()` routes via `min(stop, candle.open)` long / `max(stop, candle.open)` short — honest case.
- Target exits: fill exactly at target; no positive slippage credited (Q3).
- Commission/swap: computed and recorded as `Position.commission` (currency/lot) and `Position.swap` (price-units = nights × swap_pts × pip). Do **not** affect `r_at_close` — A10 aggregates for equity (D3/Q1).
- `NaiveBroker` kept for A8 golden-fixture determinism; `SimulatedBroker` is the CLI default from A7 onward.

**Scope boundary:** `wf_run`/`sim_trade` (walk-forward windows) → A9. Equity/stats/verdict → A10.

## Data pipeline (Sessions A2–A3, combined)

Fetch → audit → load pipeline complete. `scripts/fetch_history.py` pulls
H1 OHLCV (Dukascopy for EURUSD/XAUUSD with a Stooq fallback, Deriv
`ticks_history` for BOOM500) into `data/history/` (gitignored, derived
cache). `scripts/audit_history.py` runs five checks (duplicate
timestamps, gaps >2x interval, FX weekend bars, DST-transition
anomalies, spread outliers), writes
`docs/data_audit_report_<INSTRUMENT>.md`, and `--load`s into `candle`
once every `gap>2` anomaly has a written disposition.

All three instruments are loaded into the dev `candle` table:

| Instrument | Rows (H1) | Coverage | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| EURUSD | 18,701 | 2023-06-12 .. 2026-06-11 (~3y) | dukascopy |
| XAUUSD | 17,766 | 2023-06-12 .. 2026-06-11 (~3y) | dukascopy |
| BOOM500 | 8,761 | ~2025-06-12 .. 2026-06-11 (~1y) | deriv |

**Constraint for human review:** Deriv's `ticks_history` only serves
~1 year of BOOM500 candle history (verified via direct pagination
debugging, not a pipeline bug). `config/BOOM500.yaml`'s walk-forward
window (`train_months: 18` + `test_months: 6` = 24 months) needs more
history than is currently available — Sessions A4–A9 will need either a
reduced BOOM500 walk-forward window or an alternate BOOM500 history
source before its walk-forward can run end-to-end.

## Out of scope for Phase A

Per Implementation Plan v3.0, Session A0: no broker, state-machine,
Docker, or deployment directories exist yet. These are Phase B work
(`src/lsb/broker/` — Session B1, operating-machine module — Session B2,
`docker/` — Session B8).

## Environment decisions

- **Dev database:** native PostgreSQL on Windows — *no Docker locally*
  (low-spec workstation). Installed at Session A1 as a portable binary
  distribution under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\PostgreSQL\17` (no admin rights, no
  Windows service); start/stop via `scripts/start_postgres.ps1`. Dev
  database `lsb_dev` and role `lsb` created per `.env.example`. Docker
  arrives only at Session B8.
- **CI:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `pytest` on every commit
  (zero tests collected is acceptable until Session A4). The
  golden-fixture determinism replay (Gate GA-1) is wired in at
  Session A8.
